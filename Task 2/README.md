### Introduction

Our task is to plan and provision a cost-effective AWS infrstructure for a new social media application development project for 50,000 single-region users.

Here are some of the design assumptions:

- 10% of the user population (or 5,000) will access the social media application concurrently
-  Each user will spend 30 seconds per page
- Each page can make up to 30 calls
- Each page will contain 30 MB of content (2/3 of them are static and will be served by S3 through CloudFront)

Based on the above assumptions, I came up with the following set of parameters as input to the AWS cost estimator.
| Design Parameter                              | Value          |
| :-------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| unique DNS calls/month                        | 10 M           |
| Calls/month                                   | 720 B          |
| Data transfer among client, app and DB        | 720 TB/month   |
| Data transfer among client, CloudFront and S3 | 1,440 TB/month |
| Size of Static Content Store                  | 10 TB/month    |
|  | |

### Initial vs. Reduced Design

The inital budget is between \$8,000 and \$10,000 per month. The design guiding principle is to put as much data as possible in memory to reduce the number of performance bottlenecks.  Initial configuration costs \$8,317 a month and the challenge is to reduce this to less than \$6,500 per month. Looking at the budget, it is evident 81% of the monthly cost is associated with the RDS instance, application servers and web servers, therefore my focus is to lower the cost by reducing the amount of memory and storage allocated to these three infrastructure components. The table below summarizes these adjustments. For the RDS instance, I have decided to keep the same vCPU count using ARM processors and reduce the memory from 128 GB to 64 GB, database storage has been reduced from 1 to 0.5 TB, and backup size has been reduced from 500 GB and 100 GB. We could migitate potential performance hits by doing more proacitve DBA-type maintenance (e.g. indexing, data partitioning and archiving).  These changes alone reduce the cost by \$1,185 (or 65% of the saving we need to produce), additionl reduction in S3 storage and number of web and applications servers yields the desired cost of \$6,482 per month.

### Initial vs. Increased Design

With the budget ceiling increased to \$20,000 per month, I have decided to follow the origial guiding principle by increasing the memory in infrastructure components that can benefit from it, an obvious choice is the RDS instance which now has 256 GB of memory. I also improved the resilience by having a failover instance in the Ohio region. The RDS instance there will be initially set up as a read replica and switched over to a primary instance during a failover. As summarized in the table below, the compute capacity in the Ohio region is slightly less than that of the primary site (for cost reason), therefore during the failover, users of the social media application might experience a slight degradation in performance. The monthly cost of this configuration is \$19,606.
